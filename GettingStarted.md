# About
This is a small collection of resources I (Matthias) used to learn what I needed to work with this project.
I'm adding it here to others that come after me don't have to go through the same odyssey (or at least have it a bit easier).

# Reading
As a non-Scala programmer these resources helped me understand the code:
- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/scala-map-method/
- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/scala-flatmap-method/
- https://www.baeldung.com/scala/either-type
- https://www.baeldung.com/scala/for-comprehension
- https://www.baeldung.com/scala/foldleft-vs-reduceleft
- https://github.com/scala/scala-parser-combinators#Documentation

# Further Help
If there is a line that uses some syntax you don't know ask ChatGPT to explain it to you.
You shouldn't trust its explanation but it often correctly tells you the name of what you don't know so you can look it up. 

# Trying things out
A good way to try things out is to start repl in debug mode with `just debugRepl` and then attach the vscode debugger with the "Attach" launch target.
